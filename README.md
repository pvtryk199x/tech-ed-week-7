# Weather app with API

In my website I've created the weather app using fetch() functiion to retieve data information.

## Instructions

1. Enter any city around the world
2. press show me the weather.
3. should show you the weather forcarst of that particular city

# Issues

I sucessfully used the fetch() fcntions but when it came to catching the unexpected errors, it was dificult so i used OpenAI (ChatGPT) to help me decihper and solve the issue.
